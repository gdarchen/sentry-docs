## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Initialize

`init` Sentry as soon as possible in your app. Once this is done, the Sentry SDK captures all unhandled exceptions.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

<Alert level="note" title="Note"><markdown>

We'll automatically assign you a Data Source Name (DSN), which looks like a standard URL. It's required by Sentry and configures the protocol, public key, server address, and project identifier. If you forget it, view _Settings -> Projects -> Client Keys (DSN)_ in sentry.io.

</markdown></Alert>

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.

- **[Learn More About Releases](/product/releases/)**

  Releases help you track regressions introduced in a new release, predict which commit caused an issue, and more.

- **[Learn More About Configuration Options](./configuration/)**

  Sentry's SDKs include many configuration options that are automatically set. You can configure your SDK using the options outlined in these pages.

- **[Enrich Event Data](./enriching-events/)**
