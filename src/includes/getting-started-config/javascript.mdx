This snippet includes:
- The [release](/product/releases/) of your application, using `process.env.npm_package_version`, which enables both [source maps](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/) and tracking of regressions and suspect commits.
- Automatic instrumentation to [monitor the performance](/platforms/javascript/performance/) of browser applications. **Note:** To reduce the volume of performance data captured, or disable it entirely, change `tracesSampleRate` to a value between 0 and 1 in production.

```javascript {tabTitle: ESM}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version, // To set your release version
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // We recommend adjusting this in production
});
```
