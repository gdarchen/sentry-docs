title: Top-Level Platform Delineation
noindex: true

We separate platform portals by the main way or mechanism that developers interact with the platform and with Sentry.

## Example

Javascript is a top-level SDK because, for the frameworks that it supports, it doesn't really matter what framework you're in. As a result, they share much of the same content.

On the other hand, Android and Java have very little overlap. As a result, they are both top level platforms.
